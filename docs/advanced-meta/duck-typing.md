# Duck Typing

In section [`__traits`](./compile-time-reflection.md#demo), we introduced the concept of [Duck Typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing).
This concept is commonly used in dynamically typed languages, such as Python.
Despite being statically typed, D also supports this feature via templates.

### Practice

Open the file `duck-typing/duck_typing.d` and compile the code.
Fix the error and defeat the final boss.
