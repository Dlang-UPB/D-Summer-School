# Memory Management

During this lab you will learn about general memory management concepts and how they relate to specific implementations in D and other widely-used programming languages.

# Motivation

Before diving into memory management, let's understand the motivation for having a memory management system in a modern programming language.

# Properties of program entities

The entities that live in our programs (basic types, arrays or aggregate types like structs and classes) have a few properties:
- name (used to identify the variable)
- address (location in program memory)
- type (depending on the language, it can be inferred or must be declared explicitly)

When talking about memory management, two (less talked about) properties are of interest: scope and lifetime.
