# D Summer School

## Write fast. Read fast. Run fast.

> "D is a multi-paradigm system programming language that combines a wide range of powerful programming concepts from the lowest to the highest levels.
> It emphasizes memory safety, program correctness, and pragmatism." - Ali Ã‡ehreli, Programming in D, 2018

Welcome to the **D Summer School (DSS)**!
This repository contains information available to the participants to the D Summer School: session text, tutorials, quizzes, exercises.
Apart from DSS participants, you can use this content by yourself to learn more about [the D programming language](https://dlang.org/).

## Summary

The aim of the program is to introduce students to the basics of the D programming language, by offering insights on key idioms and focusing on modern programming techniques.

Activities will take place during three intensive training sessions per week.
These sessions will enable students to contribute to the language and submit bug-fixing PRs to core D language repositories.
In the final week of the summer school we'll strongly encourage students to begin working at a bug-fix for one of the `bootcamp` issues posted on the [bug tracker](https://issues.dlang.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=bootcamp).
The final day of the program will be marked by a hackathon where efforts will be concentrated on delivering PRs to upstream.
Prizes will be awarded!
